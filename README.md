# Computer-Vision-Keypoints-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
Predict keypoints of the images using Resnet deep learning models. 
In this project, I use knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face.

Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition.
